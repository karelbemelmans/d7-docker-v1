# Drupal 7 Docker full image v1

This Dockerfile extends the [karelbemelmans/d7-docker-base](https://github.com/karelbemelmans/d7-docker-base) image and adds a lot of Drupal contrib modules, themes and libraries. The purpose of this project is to serve as an example base image.

## Use this image in production

An example production container could be as simple as below. This file is taken from my blog post about [Running Drupal 7 on Amazon Web Services](https://www.karelbemelmans.com/2016/06/running-drupal-7-on-aws---part-2/).

```
FROM karelbemelmans/d7-docker-v1

# Copy our local settings.php file into the container.
# This file is generated by the AWS CF LaunchConfiguration during the stack
# creation. An example file is provided here.
COPY settings.php sites/default/settings.php

# Done.
```
